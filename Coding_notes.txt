I have a big box with many particles. Every particle is contained in a CONTAINER_COORDINATES sized box. Whenever they hit the sides of the box, they bounce back.
BOUNCING ON THE CONTAINER WALLS IS IMPLEMENTED

- Creating particles works
- Bouncing on walls works

How to check if particle is on the right side:
    Check isHot
    Check position (should be either bigger or smaller than middle)

How to pass through gate:
    Check if particle is on right side AND check if it's at the gate

How to check gate:
    Check which direction the particle is heading in
    Check y location
